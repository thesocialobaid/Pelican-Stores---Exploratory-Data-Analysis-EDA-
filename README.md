# Pelican-Stores---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Pelican Stores** dataset as part of the **Probability and Statistics (24L-0509)** course at **FAST NUCES Lahore**.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to utilize descriptive statistics to understand customer purchasing behavior, analyze the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, and investigate the relationship between customer demographics (Age) and Net Sales.

## 🚀 Key Insights
- **Promotional Impact:** Promotional customers represent **70%** of the dataset and outspend regular customers by an average of **$22.30** per transaction.
- **Demographic Neutrality:** There is a negligible correlation (**r = -0.0106**) between Age and Net Sales, suggesting that marketing should focus on customer loyalty/promotions rather than age brackets.
- **Data Distribution:** Net Sales are strongly right-skewed (**Skewness: 1.71**), driven by high-value outliers in the $250+ range.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Anaconda
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Histogram of Net Sales with KDE.
- Box-and-Whisker plots for Customer Type comparison.
- Scatter plots with Regression lines for Age vs. Sales.
- Violin plots for age-group density analysis.
